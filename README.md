# Algorithm Challenges

A personal playground for solving algorithms using JavaScript. As a programmer you can never get enough practice with algorithms and data structures, so I set this simple little repo up in order to get a few challenges as regularly as I can manage. Feel free to clone the repo and test yourself with the challenges. 

To run your code, make sure you have node installed. From your terminal cd into the file your challenge is located in, and run the command: node followed by the file name. 

## example:
You're working on the anagram.js file.
* userName$ cd anagram.js
* userName$ node anagram.js
